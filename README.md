# Fractal Generation Project

## Overview
This project is dedicated to generating various types of fractals, including the Barnsley Fern, Koch Snowflake, 3D Double Seashell, and a 3D Fractal Tree. Each fractal is generated using specific mathematical formulas and visualized with Python's matplotlib library. The project is structured modularly, with separate scripts for each fractal pattern and a common utilities file for shared functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- matplotlib
- numpy

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fractal-generation.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```

### Running the Project
To generate a specific fractal, run the `main.py` script with Python:
```
python main.py
```
NOTE:
 After each window pops up, close the window then press Enter in the terminal window to continue with the next plot

By default, `main.py` is set up to generate all included fractal patterns. You can modify this script to generate specific fractals or to change parameters such as the number of points or the recursion depth.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: The entry point of the project, responsible for invoking the generation of different fractals.
- `utils.py`: Contains common utilities and shared functions used across multiple fractal scripts.
- `fractal_fern.py`: Defines the function to generate and plot the Barnsley Fern fractal.
- `fractal_seashell.py`: Implements the generation and visualization of the 3D Double Seashell fractal.
- `fractal_tree.py`: Provides the functionality to generate and visualize a 3D Fractal Tree.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this project! Whether you have suggestions for new fractal patterns to include, improvements to existing algorithms, or bug fixes, please feel free to make a pull request or open an issue.
